# Robotic-Arm
Arduino Based Robotic with Distance Measurement Capabilities

This was a group project where I worked with a team of four other students in the Electronic and Computer engineering department at DUT to design, develop and demonstrate this robotic arm. 
My role in this project was Lead Electro-Mechanical Servo Motor Engineer. My tasks were to test, compile and upload code to the arduino that would allow the servo motors to accurately control the movement of the robotic arm via their actuation.

The distance measurement capabilities of the project derive from the two ultrasonic sensors that measure both the vertical and horizontal distances from the object/obstacle.

The Robotic_Arm_Wired.ino file was used for prototyping the robotic arm without wireless communication, rather the joysticks and robotic arm were part of the same system.

The Robotic_Arm_Wireless folder contains the final Arduino codes for the Control Centre and Robotic Arm subsystems that interact via wireless communication using NRF modules.

Additionally I have made available the final Circuit Schematics, Wiring Tables and the final report I wrote for the project for further clarity.
